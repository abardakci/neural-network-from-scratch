My neural network implementation using only NumPy, featuring dense layers with ReLU activation, Softmax with categorical cross-entropy loss, forward propagation, and backpropagation.

Tested with the MNIST dataset and achieved over %90 test accuracy. 

To run main.py, place mnist_train.csv and mnist_test.csv in the project folder, open terminal and run "python src/main.py".
